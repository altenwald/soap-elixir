# SOAP for Elixir

SOAP is a mechanism for Remote Procedure Call using XML. This library is implementing
this standard for Elixir.

## Installation

It's still not available for hex, so you can install it this way:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:soap, github: "altenwald/soap"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc) using
the command `mix docs`.
